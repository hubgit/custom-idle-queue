## Browser-Support
This module is using the [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) and the [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)-Object. If your runtime does not support them, you have to add them via polyfills.
